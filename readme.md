# Mac OS PF Blocklists and Hosts File update script

Run these scripts if you desire an inbound/outbound IP blocklist for your Mac.
In addition, hosts file will be updated as well.

NOTE: Run these scripts at your own risk. I am not responsible if you break a Mac following any of these steps.

- Run the "setup-anchor" file first before proceeding to the "update-blocklist" file

- Hosts file blocklists
- IP blocklists do not proceed to run until internet connectivity is established.
